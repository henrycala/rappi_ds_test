# Intro

Hello there! First of all, thank you for applying for Rappi's Data Scientist role. We have a lot of exciting stuff to build and we are glad you chose to apply. The goal of this quiz is to test your skills as a Data Scientist.

# Instructions

You will find a file as part of this zip named `house_sales.csv`. This file contains a dataset of housing sales from a specific region in the United States. Your goal is to build a model that best predicts housing prices from that region and identify the variables that affect more the prices. We have sampled a test set out of the original dataset that we will use to grade your model.

- **You will have 48h from the moment we sent you this quiz**
- This test is not tied to a particular language or framework. You can use the tools you feel most comfortable with, however, **you must submit instructions as to how to run your code and build your model**.
- Getting to the *right* solution is not the most important thing here. We will evaluate each candidate on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration their level of expertise. **We mean it**.
  - The **most important part** is that you show us your methodology and way of work and thinking. Describe in a clear fashion your ideas, argument correctly each step, and communicate your findings properly is more important than build a perfect model
- This test is supposed to mimic work in real life, therefore, feel free to look things up on the web
  - Feel free to use custom libraries you found on the web. Make sure you include them as part of your submission
